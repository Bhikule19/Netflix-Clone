# Netflix-Clone

**Netflix clone** with **Landing page** and **Netflix Web App** created using _HTML_, _CSS_, _Javascript_ and _API_

As a frontend developer, I built a Netflix UI clone featuring a landing page and a web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API. <br>

I utilized **advanced JavaScript** concepts such as **Promises** and **Fetch** to connect to the **API** and _retrieve movie data with categories for the web app._

The project allowed me to showcase my skills in web design and frontend development, as I was able to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix interface.<br>

I created a responsive user experience by _dynamically retrieving and displaying data from the API_.
